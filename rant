All right, quick question. When we're dealing with CSS properties and we have them initialize and they see it in the styles.css file. What happens? We move it to the right, but like you say we get the pen into the right side so it's always going to get pinned there. But what I'm wondering is, the moment I change that in a JavaScript file, if I change it to, like, write negative 10, right? Will it always stay at a negative 10 until I change it back? And what I'm wondering is, so it's initialized to the red 0, and then like a couple of seconds later, and this in my code or like a toddler to a button, like a press button and then moves to object right, negative 10 will always stay at the negative 10 and didn't make pretty much and will never go back.
